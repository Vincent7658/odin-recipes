    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup high-quality extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic<em>minced</em></li>
        <li>1 baguette, preferably a day old<em>thinely sliced</em></li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 ounces Parmesan cheese<em>freshly grated</em></li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 T anchovie paste</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 to 6 heads of romaine lettuce<em>rinsed, patted dry, and sorted</em></li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>In a very large bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup olive oil and garlic. 
                Let sit for at least half an hour. </li>
            <li> While the garlic is sitting, make the croutons. Spread the baguette slices out 
                on a baking sheet. (You may need to do in batches.)
                Brush or spray with olive oil (or melted butter). If you want garlicky croutons,
                dip pastry brush in the garlic infused oil you have sitting in Step 1.
                Broil for a couple of minutes until the tops are lightly browned. (Note: do not 
                walk away, these can easily go from browned to burnt.) Remove and let cool.
                The steps up until this point can be made ahead. </li>
            <li>Add minced anchovies (or anchovy paste, if using) and eggs to the oil-garlic mixture. 
                Whisk until creamy. Add salt and pepper and 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Whisk in half of the 
                Parmesan cheese. Taste, add more lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste. The lemon should 
                give an edge to the dressing, but not overwhelm it. </li>
            <li>Using your hands, tear off chunks of lettuce from the heads of romaine lettuce 
                (do not use a knife to cut). Add to the dressing and toss until coated. Add the 
                rest of the Parmesan cheese, and toss. </li>
            <li>Coarsely chop the toasted bread into croutons and add to the salad. Brush in any crumbs 
                from chopping the bread, too. Toss and serve immediately. </li>
        </ol>
